Here's a sample template for a database documentation for the Movie_rental project:
#Database Design
•	The Movie_rental database has three main tables: movies, customers, and rentals.
•	The movies table stores information on the movies available for rent, including the movie title, genre, and release date.
•	The customers table stores information on the customers, including their name, address, and age.
•	The rentals table stores information on the rentals, including the customer ID, movie ID, rental date, and return date.
•	The movies and customers tables have a primary key movie_id and customer_id, respectively.
•	The rentals table has a foreign key movie_id and customer_id that references the primary key of movies and customers table, respectively.
